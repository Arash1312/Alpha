# Remote Light Control (IoT)

This project allows you to remotely turn OFF the lights in your home using a Wi-Fi–enabled microcontroller (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32).  
The system uses a secure HTTP endpoint and a relay module connected to the lamp circuit.

## Features
- Remote ON/OFF control
- Secure API key authentication
- Simple REST API
- Works with ESP8266 / ESP32

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP8266 or ESP32 board
- Relay module
- Lamp or light circuit
- 5V power supply

## Security Notice
Never expose the device directly to the public internet without authentication, HTTPS tunneling, or a VPN.
